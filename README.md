# segmented-display

In this project I am making oversize segmented displays. There are two variants that I have created so far. A edge lit version and a back lit version. 

I started with a simple 8 segmented display (missing the dot) then moved on to a 16 segmented display for full alpha numeric. All of these are cut with acrylic and either use ws2812 tape or "bullet" style LEDs.
